![Screenshot 2024-08-07 at 17 34 24](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9ec4fcf-9025-48bc-b197-405edaf89aa2)

Welcome to the **Rust Control Flow Exercises** repository! This project contains a series of practice problems and examples related to the Control Flow chapter of the Rust programming language tutorial. These exercises will help you get hands-on experience with various control flow constructs in Rust, such as loops, conditional statements, and more.

## Overview

This repository includes several Rust files located in the `src/bin` directory, each demonstrating different control flow mechanisms. The goal is to provide practical examples and exercises to enhance your understanding of Rust's control flow features.

- **`src/bin/`**: Contains Rust source files for different control flow exercises.
  - **`TMP-converter`**: Example demonstrating [specific concept or feature].
  - **`fibonacci.rs`**: Example demonstrating [specific concept or feature].

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rust-control-flow-exercises.git
    cd rust-control-flow-exercises
```
2. Run Exercises:
To run a specific exercise, use the following command, replacing example with the name of the file (without the .rs extension):
    ```sh
    cargo run --bin filename
    ```
    For example:

    ```sh
    cargo run --bin TMP-converter
    cargo run --bin fibonacci
    cargo run --bin christmas
    ```

3. Explore and Modify:
Feel free to explore the exercises and modify the code to test different scenarios. The files are designed to be self-contained and provide a good starting point for learning Rust’s control flow features.
